h2. Introducing Remote Test Containers

Petty early this year, there was already one feature in Exxam 2 that was going to be pretty interesting, so it was basically the basis of any refactoring work that was done in the Exxam2 Branch on Github: Remote Test Containers.

So, infact, right before the "JAX 2010 London presentation":http://slideshare.net i had a working demo that showcasts the idea.

Just have a look at the video below. The API might have changed meanwhile, but i thought its worthwhile to link here, somehow to tease whats going to come.
